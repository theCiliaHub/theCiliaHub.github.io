Absence of TTL3 leads to absence of glycylation on axonemes, destabilising motile ependymal cilia and resulting in ciliary disassembly (23897886, 25180231).","localization":"cilia","reference":["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18586949","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20188560"],"functional_category":["Cytoskeleton: microtubule: tubulin"," Ciliary assembly/disassembly"," T cell biology"," Motile cilium"," Non-motile cilium / primary cilium"," Reproduction & sperm"," Ciliary assembly/disassembly"," Cytoskeleton/adhesion links"],"ciliopathy":"","complex_names":"","gene_annotation":"","pfam_ids":"PF03133","domain_descriptions":"Tubulin-tyrosine ligase/Tubulin polyglutamylase; Tubulin tyrosine ligase-like monoglycylase"},{"gene":"TTLL9","ensembl_id":"ENSG00000131044","description":"tubulin tyrosine ligase like 9 [Source:HGNC Symbol,Acc:HGNC:16118]","synonym":"C20ORF125, DJ310O13.1","omim_id":"619838","functional_summary":"伪-tubulin glutamylase required for the elongation of the polyglutamate side chains, and for the normal assembly and function of cilia (18586949, 20188560).","localization":["basal body","cilia"],"reference":["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24375934","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28154160"],"functional_category":["Basal body / centriole"," Rootlets / ciliary pocket"," Cytoskeleton: microtubule: tubulin"," Ciliary assembly/disassembly"," T cell biology"," Motile cilium"," Reproduction & sperm"," Cytoskeleton/adhesion links"],"ciliopathy":"","complex_names":"","gene_annotation":"","pfam_ids":"PF03133","domain_descriptions":"Tubulin-tyrosine ligase/Tubulin polyglutamylase"},{"gene":"TUB","ensembl_id":"ENSG00000166402","description":"TUB bipartite transcription factor [Source:HGNC Symbol,Acc:HGNC:12406]","synonym":"RD5","omim_id":"601197","functional_summary":"Mutations have been associated with reti l and cochlear degeneration, as well as obesity (24375934).
